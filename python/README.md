# Prism Python SDK

This package is the Python integration layer above the Rust AURORA/Prism kernel. It speaks the
repository's newline-delimited JSON-RPC MCP transport using only the Python standard library.

```python
from prism_sdk import Client, Workspace

with Client(["../target/release/bioprism-mcp", "--root", ".."], cwd="python") as client:
    workspace = Workspace(client)
    report = workspace.developer_delivery_audit(
        request_id="notebook-1",
        targets=["developer_platform", "repository_scope"],
    )
    print(report["release_request"]["targets"])
```

The async client has the same lifecycle and result semantics:

```python
from prism_sdk import AsyncClient, AsyncWorkspace

async with AsyncClient(["../target/release/bioprism-mcp", "--root", ".."], cwd="python") as client:
    report = await AsyncWorkspace(client).developer_delivery_audit()
```

The SDK keeps JSON-RPC transport failures, protocol violations, server errors, and structured tool
refusals distinct. It never invokes a shell, accepts unbounded frames, turns a refusal into a
successful value, or recreates the Rust domain model. `Workspace` helpers are deliberately thin
facades over exact MCP tools; `tool()` remains available for every current and future domain.
