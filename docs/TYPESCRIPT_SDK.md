# TypeScript SDK

This document is the executable integration note for blueprint modules **11.06** (TypeScript SDK)
and **40.15** (TypeScript SDK contract). The package and its tests are intentionally kept beside
the Rust workspace so those two modules have a citable, reviewable implementation rather than a
foreign-artifact placeholder.

The repository ships `typescript/`, a small ESM package for clients that can use the standard
Fetch API. It is intentionally an integration layer over `bioprism-api`, not a second domain
implementation. The Rust MCP server remains the authority for tool schemas, refusal semantics,
canonical serialization, and scientific contracts.

## Start a gateway

```bash
cargo run -p bioprism-api -- --root . --bind 127.0.0.1:8787 --token 0123456789abcdef
```

In another terminal:

```bash
cd typescript
npm install
npm test
```

The production package has no runtime dependency. The `fetch` implementation can be supplied for
Node, a browser, a service worker, a test double, or a platform-specific request layer:

```typescript
const api = new ApiClient({
  baseUrl: "http://127.0.0.1:8787",
  bearerToken: process.env.PRISM_TOKEN,
  timeoutMs: 15_000,
  maxResponseBytes: 2_000_000,
  fetch: globalThis.fetch,
});
```

The gateway token must contain at least sixteen visible characters. Never put it in a URL, query
parameter, browser local-storage value, or a public client bundle. Browser deployments should
normally call an operator-owned same-origin proxy so the gateway token stays server-side; the SDK
supports browser fetch for controlled, non-secret deployments and local development.

## Transport and errors

`ApiClient.request` accepts only origin-form paths and the gateway's bounded HTTP methods. JSON
payloads are checked for unsupported values, non-finite numbers, excessive nesting, control-line
breaks, and a configurable byte ceiling. Responses are read incrementally through
`ReadableStream`, stopped when `maxResponseBytes` is crossed, decoded as UTF-8, and required to be
JSON objects on JSON routes.

Errors are deliberately distinct:

| Error | Meaning | Retry implication |
|---|---|---|
| `ArgumentError` | the caller supplied an unsafe or unbounded value | fix the call; do not retry unchanged |
| `TransportError` | fetch, timeout, abort, or response-read failure | retry only under the caller's policy |
| `ResponseTooLargeError` | the response crossed the local byte ceiling | narrow the route/page or raise the bound intentionally |
| `ApiError` | the gateway returned an HTTP error and structured payload | inspect status/code; a 4xx is not a domain success |
| `ProtocolError` | malformed JSON, SSE, or response shape | investigate compatibility or corruption |
| `ToolRefusalError` | `requireToolSuccess` observed an MCP/domain refusal | preserve the refusal; do not blindly retry |

`callTool` itself does not throw for a structured tool refusal when the HTTP call succeeded. This
is important for safety, evaluation, and evidence workflows where a refusal is a valid result that
must be rendered, stored, or compared. Use `requireToolSuccess` only at a boundary whose contract
requires a successful tool result.

## Discovery and cross-domain calls

The client exposes `health`, `ready`, `capabilities`, `tools`, and `metrics` for startup and
operator discovery. `tools()` returns the server's live catalogue rather than a stale generated
list. `callTool` accepts any path-safe tool name and a JSON object, so a client can use new Rust
tools before the TypeScript package has a convenience method.

Convenience methods currently cover:

- `traceOtelIngest`: bounded OTLP JSON import with semantic-loss reporting;
- `metricsProfileAudit` and `metricsAnalyticsAudit`: missingness-aware capability profiles plus
  bounded scalar, paired-contrast, cost/latency, replicate, and calibration analytics;
- `bioCapabilityEvidenceAudit`: evidence posture;
- `bioAtlasPublicationAudit`: atlas, evidence, card, and leaderboard release gates;
- `developerDeliveryAudit`: developer-platform delivery evidence;
- `developerWorkbench`: digest-bound authoring/notebook audit, capability dashboard query, and
  review-only CI workflow planning;
- `agentMission`: deterministic cross-domain mission planning or explicitly allow-listed execution
  with refusal propagation, output budgets, and optional JSON-pointer bindings;
- `runtimeExecutionSimulate`: deterministic replay, budget, fault, and fork evidence.

These helpers type the contract's top-level shape while leaving nested domain records as JSON
objects where the Rust crate is authoritative. That keeps the client useful across all domain
families without maintaining a fragile partial clone of 119 tool schemas. `capabilityDiscover`
searches the explicit cross-domain catalogue and can request authoritative schemas for matches;
`capabilityAudit` verifies catalogue/schema parity and exposes coverage gaps.

## Events and webhooks

```typescript
const page = await api.events(0, 100);
const stream = await api.eventStream(page.page.next_after, 100);
for (const event of stream.events) {
  console.log(event.id, event.event, JSON.parse(event.data));
}

const subscription = await api.subscribe(
  "https://worker.example.invalid/prism-events",
  "a-long-operator-managed-secret",
  { subscriptionId: "worker-a", events: ["tool.completed", "tool.refused"] },
);
const deliveries = await api.deliveries(subscription.subscription.id);
// An operator-owned worker sends the signed envelope, then acknowledges only accepted ids.
await api.acknowledge(subscription.subscription.id, deliveries.page.deliveries.map((d) => d.delivery_id));
```

The SSE route is a bounded snapshot, not a streaming connection. `eventStream` returns the raw
text, parsed events, content type, and next cursor so an application can decide whether to poll,
persist, or hand off to a real EventSource implementation. The webhook methods only manage the
server-side outbox. They do not send to endpoint URLs, retry on their own, or expose subscription
secrets.

## Compatibility posture

The API's `capabilities` response is the runtime compatibility anchor. Clients should check
`tool_count`, transport flags, and limits before enabling a workflow. REST and JSON-RPC calls share
the same in-process dispatcher, but gRPC, TLS termination, durable event storage, and an external
delivery worker remain deployment responsibilities. A client must not infer those features from
the presence of an HTTP listener.
