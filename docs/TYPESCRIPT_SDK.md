# TypeScript SDK

This document is the executable integration note for blueprint modules **11.06** (TypeScript SDK)
and **40.15** (TypeScript SDK contract). The package and its tests are intentionally kept beside
the Rust workspace so those two modules have a citable, reviewable implementation rather than a
foreign-artifact placeholder.

The repository ships `typescript/`, a small ESM package for clients that can use the standard
Fetch API. It is intentionally an integration layer over `bioprism-api`, not a second domain
implementation. The Rust MCP server remains the authority for tool schemas, refusal semantics,
canonical serialization, and scientific contracts.

## Start a gateway

```bash
cargo run -p bioprism-api -- --root . --bind 127.0.0.1:8787 --token 0123456789abcdef \
  --mission-state .local/mission-state.json --event-state .local/event-state.json
```

In another terminal:

```bash
cd typescript
npm install
npm test
```

The production package has no runtime dependency. The `fetch` implementation can be supplied for
Node, a browser, a service worker, a test double, or a platform-specific request layer:

```typescript
const api = new ApiClient({
  baseUrl: "http://127.0.0.1:8787",
  bearerToken: process.env.PRISM_TOKEN,
  timeoutMs: 15_000,
  maxResponseBytes: 2_000_000,
  fetch: globalThis.fetch,
});
```

The gateway token must contain at least sixteen visible characters. Never put it in a URL, query
parameter, browser local-storage value, or a public client bundle. Browser deployments should
normally call an operator-owned same-origin proxy so the gateway token stays server-side; the SDK
supports browser fetch for controlled, non-secret deployments and local development.

## Transport and errors

`ApiClient.request` accepts only origin-form paths and the gateway's bounded HTTP methods. JSON
payloads are checked for unsupported values, non-finite numbers, excessive nesting, control-line
breaks, and a configurable byte ceiling. Responses are read incrementally through
`ReadableStream`, stopped when `maxResponseBytes` is crossed, decoded as UTF-8, and required to be
JSON objects on JSON routes.

Errors are deliberately distinct:

| Error | Meaning | Retry implication |
|---|---|---|
| `ArgumentError` | the caller supplied an unsafe or unbounded value | fix the call; do not retry unchanged |
| `TransportError` | fetch, timeout, abort, or response-read failure | retry only under the caller's policy |
| `ResponseTooLargeError` | the response crossed the local byte ceiling | narrow the route/page or raise the bound intentionally |
| `ApiError` | the gateway returned an HTTP error and structured payload | inspect status/code; a 4xx is not a domain success |
| `ProtocolError` | malformed JSON, SSE, or response shape | investigate compatibility or corruption |
| `ToolRefusalError` | `requireToolSuccess` observed an MCP/domain refusal | preserve the refusal; do not blindly retry |

`callTool` itself does not throw for a structured tool refusal when the HTTP call succeeded. This
is important for safety, evaluation, and evidence workflows where a refusal is a valid result that
must be rendered, stored, or compared. Use `requireToolSuccess` only at a boundary whose contract
requires a successful tool result.

## Discovery and cross-domain calls

The client exposes `health`, `ready`, `capabilities`, `tools`, and `metrics` for startup and
operator discovery. `tools()` returns the server's live catalogue rather than a stale generated
list. `callTool` accepts any path-safe tool name and a JSON object, so a client can use new Rust
tools before the TypeScript package has a convenience method.

Convenience methods currently cover:

- `traceOtelIngest`: bounded OTLP JSON import with semantic-loss reporting;
- `metricsProfileAudit` and `metricsAnalyticsAudit`: missingness-aware capability profiles plus
  bounded scalar, paired-contrast, cost/latency, replicate, and calibration analytics;
- `bioCapabilityEvidenceAudit`: evidence posture;
- `bioAtlasPublicationAudit`: atlas, evidence, card, and leaderboard release gates;
- `developerDeliveryAudit`: developer-platform delivery evidence;
- `developerWorkbench`: digest-bound authoring/notebook audit, capability dashboard query, and
  review-only CI workflow planning;
- `agentMission`: deterministic cross-domain mission planning or explicitly allow-listed execution
  with refusal propagation, output budgets, and optional JSON-pointer bindings;
- `submitMission`, `missionStatus`, and `cancelMission`: typed asynchronous mission jobs with
  bounded polling, authoritative terminal reports, and cooperative cancellation between nested
calls or parallel batches;
  `deleteMission` removes only terminal jobs from the bounded registry, preserving active work.
- `runtimeExecutionSimulate`: deterministic replay, budget, fault, and fork evidence.
- `repositoryCatalog`, `repositoryBundle`, and `repositoryImpact`: bounded repository discovery,
  route-specific progressive disclosure, and changed-module impact checks;
- `telemetryProject`: redacted telemetry projection with explicit treatment policy, trace, and
  optional observed-metric evidence fields.

The complete live tool surface is also available through `toolCatalogue()`, `planTool()`, and
`toolChecked()`. The catalogue is bounded and SHA-256 addressed from `/v1/tools`; plans are
side-effect free and enforce only conservative transport-shape rules. Unsupported JSON Schema
features are warnings rather than hidden validation, and `toolChecked()` keeps structured MCP
refusals in the same raw response envelope as `callTool()`.

`missionPreflight()` applies the same contract to an `AgentMissionArgs` dependency graph, and
`assertMissionPreflight()` converts a failed report into a typed local error. The report returns
request and catalogue digests, deterministic waves, per-step schema reports, JSON-pointer binding
findings, recursion checks, execution allow-list findings, and parallel-wave budget checks without
issuing a tool call. `execution_mode: "parallel_waves"` explicitly opts into bounded concurrent
dispatch for independent steps; `max_parallelism` caps each batch at 16 or less, and serial execution
remains the default. Executed `agentMission()` responses type the authoritative clock-free
`execution_trace` with contiguous lifecycle, wave, refusal, block, and byte-accounting events. Pass
the earlier `ToolCatalogue` snapshot to guarantee that mission review and subsequent checked calls
refer to the same live schema set; the Rust `agent_mission` tool remains the execution authority.
`MissionJob` makes queued, running, planned, succeeded, partial, failed, and cancelled states
explicit; cancellation is a request to stop future dispatch, not a force-kill or rollback claim.
Its optional `progress: MissionProgress` field provides one bounded shape for queued, live, and
terminal dashboards: phase, current wave, active/completed steps, outcome counters, returned bytes,
and the latest clock-free trace sequence/event. The terminal `result` and its execution trace remain
authoritative for replay and domain interpretation. When the gateway restores a bounded checkpoint,
`recovered_after_restart` is true and the job is an explicit failed interruption; `result_omitted`
exposes byte-count and SHA-256 metadata when a durable snapshot could not retain a large report.
`missionTrace(missionId, after, limit)` provides a typed `MissionTracePage` with ordered events,
an exclusive `next_after` cursor, and explicit retention-gap metadata.
`waitMission(missionId, { timeoutMs, pollIntervalMs, signal })` performs bounded, abortable
polling and returns only a terminal `MissionJob`; `MissionWaitTimeoutError` carries the last
authoritative live snapshot so an operator can resume or cancel without losing progress.
`missionPersistence()` and `flushMissionPersistence()` expose the same bounded checkpoint status
and explicit flush/readiness check for operator tooling.
`eventPersistence()` and `flushEventPersistence()` provide the event-cursor equivalent while
typing the explicit non-durability of webhook subscriptions and pending deliveries.

These helpers type the contract's top-level shape while leaving nested domain records as JSON
objects where the Rust crate is authoritative. That keeps the client useful across all domain
families without maintaining a fragile partial clone of 122 tool schemas. `capabilityDiscover`
searches the explicit cross-domain catalogue and can request authoritative schemas for matches;
`capabilityAudit` verifies catalogue/schema parity and exposes coverage gaps; `capabilityRoute`
batches named needs into a non-executing, digest-bound route proposal; `missionFromRoute` turns a
fully resolved route into a provenance-preserving explicit mission only after caller-selected
tools and arguments are supplied. The route response retains per-need candidate domains and a
`route_coverage` ledger so a caller can see which domains contributed evidence before selecting
tools. `adapterPlan` selects native
or Python-delegated biological and clinical source routes—including FHIR—by explicit format and source shape while preserving
dependency and semantic-loss boundaries.
`capabilityRouteReview` accepts the route plus caller-selected `MissionRouteSelection` values and
returns typed `CapabilityRouteReviewResult` diagnostics. Ready results include deterministic
dependency waves and a mission draft while retaining the `mission_preflight_required` boundary;
blocked results preserve structured findings without executing anything. Set `validate_schemas: true`
to receive bounded authoritative schema reports for the selected arguments; this remains review
evidence and does not authorize execution.

## Events and webhooks

```typescript
const page = await api.events(0, 100);
const stream = await api.eventStream(page.page.next_after, 100);
for (const event of stream.events) {
  console.log(event.id, event.event, JSON.parse(event.data));
}

const subscription = await api.subscribe(
  "https://worker.example.invalid/prism-events",
  "a-long-operator-managed-secret",
  { subscriptionId: "worker-a", events: ["tool.completed", "tool.refused"] },
);
const deliveries = await api.deliveries(subscription.subscription.id);
// An operator-owned worker sends the signed envelope, then acknowledges only accepted ids.
await api.acknowledge(subscription.subscription.id, deliveries.page.deliveries.map((d) => d.delivery_id));
// Explicit operator recovery keeps delivery IDs stable and resets selected attempts.
await api.replay(subscription.subscription.id, deliveries.page.deliveries.map((d) => d.delivery_id));
```

The SSE route is a bounded snapshot, not a streaming connection. `eventStream` returns the raw
text, parsed events, content type, and next cursor so an application can decide whether to poll,
persist, or hand off to a real EventSource implementation. The webhook methods only manage the
server-side outbox. They do not send to endpoint URLs, retry on their own, or expose subscription
secrets.

## Compatibility posture

The API's `capabilities` response is the runtime compatibility anchor. Clients should check
`tool_count`, transport flags, and limits before enabling a workflow. REST and JSON-RPC calls share
the same in-process dispatcher, but gRPC, TLS termination, durable event storage, and an external
delivery worker remain deployment responsibilities. A client must not infer those features from
the presence of an HTTP listener.
